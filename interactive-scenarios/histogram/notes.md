**Prompt 1 (milestone 1):**

The generated solution works properly. The execution time (21ms using H100) and the solution itself is comparable with most single-response prompts from His1-3.

*Skipping milestone 2 (already covered in the first response)*

**Prompt 2 (milestone 3):**

The generated solution works properly. The execution time (2.8ms using H100) corresponds to solutions of His4. It properly used `itemsPerThread == 8` with sequential iteration over the input buffer.

**Prompt 3 (milestone 4):**

The generated solution made 32 copies of the histogram in the shared memory, but they used sequential layout which does not prevent bank conflicts. No performance improvement over the previous solution.

**Prompt 4 (milestone 4):**

The solution properly divided the copies into banks according to the hint which specified the indexing.

**EXTENSION:**

Since the prompting went smoothly, we decided to take the experiment a few steps beyond the scenario.

**Prompt 5:**

As suggested, the solution properly reorders the iteration to create better coalesced loads.

**Prompt 6:**

LLM was suggested to increase the block size and `itemsPerThread`, but it remains still very conservative. Both values were just multiplied by two (block size now 512, `itemsPerThread` increased to 64). According to our parameter space exploration, optimal block size is 1024, and `itemsPerThread` should be set about 512.

We decided to stop the experiment here as the objectives were fulfilled and the parameter selection would require mircomanagement (we would need to provide explicit values to the LLM, but any coder can fix that in the code).
