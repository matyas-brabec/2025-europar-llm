When a newly computed distance of a data point is lower than `max_distance`, it is added to the candidate buffer; otherwise, it can be safely ignored. Update this variable whenever the k-th nearest neighbor in the intermediate result is updated.\n\nProcess the input data iteratively in batches. Each batch of input points is loaded into shared memory by the whole thread block. Each warp then uses the cached data points to compute their corresponding distances from its own query point. The data points are then filtered by `max_distance` and, if they are closer than `max_distance`, added to the buffer of candidates. Use warp ballot instructions to determine the number of candidates that are closer than `max_distance`. Then, update the number of stored candidates and store the new candidates in the buffer at appropriate positions (using the results of the warp ballot and each thread's lane ID).\n\nWhenever the buffer is full, merge it with the intermediate result in the following way:\n\n0. (Invariant) The intermediate result is sorted in ascending order.\n1. Swap the content of the buffer and the intermediate result so that the buffer is in registers.\n2. Sort the buffer using the Bitonic Sort algorithm in ascending order.\n3. Merge the buffer and the intermediate result into the registers. Each element of the merged result is the minimum of the two elements at positions `i` and `k - i - 1`, one from the buffer and the other from the intermediate result. The merged result is a bitonic sequence containing the first `k` elements of the buffer and the intermediate result. The remaining elements can be safely discarded.\n4. Sort the merged result in ascending order using the Bitonic Sort algorithm. This produces an updated intermediate result.\n\nYou can use the following unoptimized pseudocode for serial Bitonic Sort as a reference for the implementation of the Bitonic Sort algorithm:\n\n```pseudocode\nfor (k = 2; k <= n; k *= 2) // k is doubled every iteration\n    for (j = k/2; j > 0; j /= 2) // j is halved at every iteration, with truncation of fractional parts\n        for (i = 0; i < n; i++)\n            l = bitwiseXOR (i, j); // in C-like languages this is \"i ^ j\"\n            if (l > i)\n                if (  (bitwiseAND (i, k) == 0) AND (arr[i] > arr[l])\n                    OR (bitwiseAND (i, k) != 0) AND (arr[i] < arr[l]) )\n                        swap the elements arr[i] and arr[l]\n```\n\nAfter the last batch of candidates is processed, remember to merge the buffer with the intermediate result (if it is not empty).\n\nIn the implementation of the Bitonic Sort algorithm, use the warp shuffle instructions to exchange elements between different threads. Since each thread stores consecutive elements, the exchanged elements always have the same index within the thread's registers.\nIf the exchanged elements are stored in registers of the same thread, they can be simply swapped in the registers without any communication with other threads.\n"}]}}
