/*
  CUDA implementation of one step of Conway's Game of Life on a bit-packed grid.

  Design choices and algorithmic details:

  - Each thread processes exactly one 64-bit word (64 cells in a row).
  - The grid is square with dimensions grid_dimensions x grid_dimensions (power of 2, >512).
  - The input and output grids are bit-packed row-major arrays of std::uint64_t.
  - Out-of-bounds (outside the grid) cells are treated as dead (0) â€” no wrapping.
  - We avoid shared/texture memory as per instructions; rely on global memory and L2/L1 caches.
  - Neighbor counting is done using bitwise "SIMD within a register" techniques:
      * Build eight 64-bit neighbor masks: N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW.
      * Compute horizontal sums per row using 3-input adders (bitwise half/full adders) to produce
        two bit-planes (ones and twos) for each row.
      * Vertically add those per-row sums to obtain the final lower-three bits (1,2,4 planes) of the
        neighbor counts (0..8). This avoids per-cell branching and explicit per-cell popcounts.
      * The next-state rule reduces to:
            next = birth | survive
            birth   = (count == 3)  = ones & twos & ~fours
            survive = alive & (count == 2 or 3) = alive & twos & ~fours
        where ones, twos, fours are the 1,2,4 bit-planes of the neighbor count per bit position.

  - Horizontal shifts with cross-word handling:
      * E = (cur >> 1) | (curR << 63)
      * W = (cur << 1) | (curL >> 63)
      * NE = (north >> 1) | (northR << 63), etc.
    Edge words (at col 0 or last col) use zero for missing neighbors.

  - Indexing:
      * width_words = grid_dimensions / 64 (also a power-of-two).
      * We pass width_log2 = log2(width_words) so row = idx >> width_log2, col = idx & (width_words - 1),
        avoiding integer division/modulo in device code.

  - Launch:
      * 1D grid, grid-stride loop to cover arbitrary sizes.
      * Thread block size 256 chosen as a good balance for register usage and occupancy on A100/H100.

  This implementation emphasizes bitwise parallelism and coalesced global access for high throughput.
