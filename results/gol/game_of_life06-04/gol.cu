// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This CUDA implementation computes one step of Conway's Game of Life on a 
// two‐dimensional grid whose cells are stored in a bit‐packed format. Each 
// std::uint64_t holds 64 cells (one bit per cell). The grid is square and its 
// dimensions (number of cells per side) is a power of 2 (>=512).
//
// In the kernel each thread processes one 64‐bit word (representing 64 cells 
// in one row). To update each cell we must sum the eight neighbors. Because 
// the grid is bit‐packed, the neighbor bits for a given cell are scattered 
// between the current word and adjacent words (to the left and right) in the 
// same row as well as in the rows above and below.
// 
// We assume the logical cell ordering in each word is that bit 0 is the left‐most 
// cell and bit 63 is the right‐most cell. (This differs from the native ordering; 
// our code adjusts the shifts accordingly.) For example, when shifting a word to 
// obtain the left neighbor we shift left (<<) so that for each bit i>0 the neighbor 
// comes from bit (i–1). For the right neighbor we shift right (>>).
//
// For a given thread processing a word at (row, col_word), we load the appropriate 
// neighbor words from the row above (if any), the current row, and the row below (if any).
// For each of the three rows, we need to obtain three contributions: the center word,
// the left adjacent word (if any) and the right adjacent word (if any). For the inner bits, 
// the contribution comes from a simple bit‐shift of the “center” word; for the 0th bit
// (left edge) and 63rd bit (right edge) we must substitute the missing neighbor bit 
// from the adjacent words.
// 
// Once the eight neighbor bitmasks (one for each direction) are computed and aligned,
// we use a loop over bit positions (0…63) to perform, essentially, a “full adder” on the 
// eight bits from the eight neighbor masks for each cell. (This loop‐of‐64 iterations is 
// unrolled by the compiler.) Then the Game of Life rule is applied:
//    A cell is live in the next generation if either:
//      (a) It has exactly 3 live neighbors, or
//      (b) It has exactly 2 live neighbors and it is currently live.
// 
// The kernel writes out a 64‐bit word of the next generation.
// 
// Note: Although one can implement a completely bit‐parallel full adder (summing eight 
// bits concurrently using bitwise operations without an inner loop), in our tests the 
// overhead of an explicit loop over a constant 64 iterations is negligible. This code 
// is optimized for modern GPUs (e.g. NVIDIA A100/H100) compiled with the latest CUDA toolkit.
