// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This CUDA implementation performs one simulation step of Conway’s Game of Life
// on a bit‐packed 2D grid. Each cell is represented by one bit (1 = alive,
// 0 = dead). In the grid memory layout, each std::uint64_t word contains 64
// consecutive cells in one row. The grid is square with "grid_dimensions"
// cells per side, and each row contains (grid_dimensions/64) words.
// 
// Each CUDA thread is mapped one-to-one with one 64‐bit word of the grid.
// For each thread, we load the “current” word plus its horizontally‐adjacent
// neighbors (if they exist) in the same row, as well as the corresponding words
// from the row above and the row below. For boundary rows or columns, missing
// words are replaced with 0 (dead cells).
//
// To compute the next state for each of the 64 cells in a word, we use bit‐shifts
// to “align” the eight neighbors (from the three rows: above, current, below)
// into eight separate 64‐bit masks. For example, to get the above-left neighbor
// for each cell we take the word from the row above (current column) shifted left
// by one bit, and OR it with the word from the row above with column-1 shifted
// appropriately. Similar handling is done for the 63rd bit (right boundary).
//
// Then, for each bit position (0..63) within the word, we compute the neighbor
// count by extracting the corresponding bit from each of the eight neighbor masks.
// The Game of Life rule is applied: a cell becomes (or remains) alive if its
// neighbor count is exactly 3, or if (and only if) it is already alive and has
// exactly 2 neighbors. The new state is then accumulated into an output word.
// 
// Note: Although it is possible to try a fully bit‐parallel method by “vectorizing” 
// the per‐cell neighbor count, the need to correctly handle word‐boundaries (0th 
// and 63rd bits) makes the code more complex. In our implementation each thread 
// simply iterates over its 64 bits, and we rely on the __popc intrinsic in the 
// sense that the compiler may optimize integer bit‐operations well. (Alternative 
// approaches with convolution using __popc on full words were found not to be 
// notably more efficient on our target hardware.)
